# GoogleMapsAudio
Google Maps has a feature that (when disabled) always allows a user to receive audio from a phoneâ€™s speakers even when the phone is connected to a Bluetooth device. See GoogleMaps/Settings/NavigationSettings/Play voice over Bluetooth.  This sample application emulates this behavior.
